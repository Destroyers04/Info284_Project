        "After taking a quick look at the dataset and the documents that was provided with it, we figured we wanted to try to predict if an entry is a Bycatch. We believe that by being able to predict Bycatch we can find out if there are any boats that are misreporting their catches. We classify an entry as a Bycatch if the \"Hovedart FAO\" does not match with \"Art FAO\". We are aware this definition of a Bycatch is somewhat limited especially considering the way \"Hovedart FAO\" is chosen, ideally we would like to classify Bycatch as non-intended catches. However, this is hard to do without information about the fishing vessel's objectives prior to departure."

        "#### k-NN\n",
        "The k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm makes predictions based on the closest data points in the training dataset. k-NN algorithms struggle when there are a lot of features involved, we only have 5 features in our dataset which makes k-NN sound pretty promising.\n",
