TO BE DONE/completed

General:
* fish-data.csv is the data set but renamed to be more user friendly when coding.

* Keep having problem with the pathing for the csv file, so in order for it to work 
  on my pc I need to use the whole pathing. ¨\*_*/¨
  # The problem seems to be with .ipynb files or YupiterNotebook, when the doc is a 
    .py it work like normal.
  
  !# Resolved. The problem was with where the different files are opperating form. 
     A .py file is opperating from the folder you noramly see it is saved; i.e 
     /documents/my_projects/INFO284/The_INFO284_exam_task, but a .ipynb is a 
     combination of .py files and .txt(?) files for each of the different moduls 
     that is used and it is this combo that is stored at the file path mensiond above.
     So the .py file in a .ipynb file is stored at the place where the Python OS(?) 
     system is stored, with is something like system/systemfiles/program_files/python.
