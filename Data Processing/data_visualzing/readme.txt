TO BE DONE/completed

General:
* fish-data.csv is the data set but renamed to be more user friendly when coding.

* Keep having problem with the pathing for the csv file, so in order for it to work 
  on my pc I need to use the whole pathing. ¨\*_*/¨
  # The problem seems to be with .ipynb files or YupiterNotebook, when the doc is a 
    .py it work like normal.
