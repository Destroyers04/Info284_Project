run <pip install -r requirement.txt> in your virtual environment to install all libraries in use.

<ul>
    <li>Pandas</li>
    <li>Numpy</li>
    <li>Matplot lib</li>
</ul>

## TODO

- Pick what we want to predict (Don't think we are supposed to predict two things)

Week 11-12(Monday 11. - Friday 22. mars 2024)

- find out which features we need (log our visualization and process in picking each features and which we don't pick)
- make visuals of the features from the dataset
- outlier handling
- find out which models fits for our predictions (log why we pick different ml models why we chose them)
- find out how we need to change our data so that it can be used for our models (log what type of processing we need to do)

Week 13(Monday 25. - Sunday 31. mars 2024)

- feature engineering

Week 14(Monday 1. - Friday 7. april 2024)

- put our processed data in the ml models (log results)
- run a grid search to find best ml params
- run the ml model again with the best params
- run a kfold on the results from new model
- validation of the results
- metrics
- start on unsupervised learning
- Summarize conclusions

## DONE
