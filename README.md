## TODO

- Pick what we want to predict (Don't think we are supposed to predict two things)
- find out which features we ned (log our visualization and process in picking each features and which we don't pick)
- find out which models fits for our predictions (log why we pick different ml models why we chose them)
- find out how we need to change our data so that it can be used for our models (log what type of processing we need to do)
- put our processed data in the ml models (log results)
- start on unsupervised learning
- Summarize conclusions
