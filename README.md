## TODO

- Pick what we want to predict (Don't think we are supposed to predict two things)

Week 11(Monday 11. - Sunday 17. mars 2024)

- find out which features we need (log our visualization and process in picking each features and which we don't pick)
- make visuals of the features from the dataset
- outlier handling
- find out which models fits for our predictions (log why we pick different ml models why we chose them)
- find out how we need to change our data so that it can be used for our models (log what type of processing we need to do)
- feature engineering

- put our processed data in the ml models (log results)
- start on unsupervised learning
- Summarize conclusions

## DONE
