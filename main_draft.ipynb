    "After taking a quick look at the dataset and the documents that was provided with it, we figured we wanted to try to predict if an entry is a Bycatch. We believe that by being able to predict Bycatch we can find out if there are any boats that are not reporting their catches properly. We classify an entry as a Bycatch if the \"Hovedart FAO\" does not match with \"Art FAO\". We are aware this definition of a Bycatch is somewhat limited especially considering the way \"Hovedart FAO\" is chosen, but if we are to define Bycatch as species that are not the top 2-3 species we would need more data."
